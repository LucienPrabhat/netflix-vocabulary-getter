<p t="6463" d="1539">In the late 17th century,</p>
<p t="8002" d="3760">a medical student named Johannes Hofer
noticed a strange illness</p>
<p t="11762" d="3831">affecting Swiss mercenaries 
serving abroad.</p>
<p t="15593" d="1029">Its symptoms,</p>
<p t="16622" d="912">including fatigue,</p>
<p t="17534" d="1039">insomnia,</p>
<p t="18573" d="1329">irregular heartbeat,</p>
<p t="19902" d="1321">indigestion,</p>
<p t="21223" d="2111">and fever were so strong,</p>
<p t="23334" d="3179">the soldiers often had to be discharged.</p>
<p t="26513" d="3932">As Hofer discovered, the cause was not
some physical disturbance,</p>
<p t="30445" d="3679">but an intense yearning for their
mountain homeland.</p>
<p t="34124" d="2360">He dubbed the condition nostalgia,</p>
<p t="36484" d="2149">from the Greek &quot;nostos&quot; for homecoming</p>
<p t="38633" d="3060">and &quot;algos&quot; for pain or longing.</p>
<p t="41693" d="5152">At first, nostalgia was considered
a particularly Swiss affliction.</p>
<p t="46845" d="4337">Some doctors proposed that
the constant sound of cowbells in the Alps</p>
<p t="51182" d="4062">caused trauma to the ear drums and brain.</p>
<p t="55244" d="4519">Commanders even forbade their soldiers
from singing traditional Swiss songs</p>
<p t="59763" d="4271">for fear that they&#39;d lead to desertion
or suicide.</p>
<p t="64034" d="5780">But as migration increased worldwide,
nostalgia was observed in various groups.</p>
<p t="69814" d="4451">It turned out that anyone separated
from their native place for a long time</p>
<p t="74265" d="2550">was vulnerable to nostalgia.</p>
<p t="76815" d="1690">And by the early 20th century,</p>
<p t="78505" d="3810">professionals no longer viewed it
as a neurological disease,</p>
<p t="82315" d="3309">but as a mental condition 
similar to depression.</p>
<p t="85624" d="1931">Psychologists of the time speculated</p>
<p t="87555" d="3811">that it represented difficulties
letting go of childhood,</p>
<p t="91366" d="3749">or even a longing to return to one&#39;s
fetal state.</p>
<p t="95115" d="1610">But over the next few decades,</p>
<p t="96725" d="4070">the understanding of nostalgia changed
in two important ways.</p>
<p t="100795" d="3400">Its meaning expanded from indicating
homesickness</p>
<p t="104195" d="3150">to a general longing for the past.</p>
<p t="107345" d="1952">And rather than an awful disease,</p>
<p t="109297" d="4288">it began to be seen as a poignant
and pleasant experience.</p>
<p t="113585" d="1990">Perhaps the most famous example of this</p>
<p t="115575" d="3864">was captured by French author 
Marcel Proust.</p>
<p t="119439" d="4007">He described how tasting a madeleine cake
he had not eaten since childhood</p>
<p t="123446" d="5720">triggered a cascade of warm
and powerful sensory associations.</p>
<p t="129166" d="5060">So what caused such a major
reversal in our view of nostalgia?</p>
<p t="134226" d="2219">Part of it has to do with science.</p>
<p t="136445" d="3311">Psychology shifted away from pure theory</p>
<p t="139756" d="4760">and towards more careful and systematic
empirical observation.</p>
<p t="144516" d="3390">So professionals realized that many
of the negative symptoms</p>
<p t="147906" d="2771">may have been simply correlated
with nostalgia</p>
<p t="150677" d="2074">rather than caused by it.</p>
<p t="152751" d="3930">And, in fact, despite being a complex
emotional state</p>
<p t="156681" d="3182">that can include feelings of loss
and sadness,</p>
<p t="159863" d="4459">nostalgia doesn&#39;t generally put people
in a negative mood.</p>
<p t="164322" d="3891">Instead, by allowing individuals 
to remember personally meaningful</p>
<p t="168213" d="3489">and rewarding experiences
they shared with others,</p>
<p t="171702" d="3340">nostalgia can boost 
psychological well-being.</p>
<p t="175042" d="3090">Studies have shown 
that inducing nostalgia in people</p>
<p t="178132" d="4520">can help increase their feelings
of self-esteem and social belonging,</p>
<p t="182652" d="2050">encourage psychological growth,</p>
<p t="184702" d="3137">and even make them act
more charitably.</p>
<p t="187839" d="3194">So rather than being a cause
of mental distress,</p>
<p t="191033" d="4590">nostalgia can be a restorative way
of coping with it.</p>
<p t="195623" d="3520">For instance, when people experience
negative emotional states,</p>
<p t="199143" d="3920">they tend to naturally use nostalgia
to reduce distress</p>
<p t="203063" d="2601">and restore well-being.</p>
<p t="205664" d="3268">Today, it seems that nostalgia 
is everywhere,</p>
<p t="208932" d="3650">partially because advertisers 
have discovered how powerful it is</p>
<p t="212582" d="2362">as a marketing technique.</p>
<p t="214944" d="4057">It&#39;s tempting to think of this as a sign
of us being stuck in the past,</p>
<p t="219001" d="3202">but that&#39;s not really how nostalgia works.</p>
<p t="222203" d="5151">Instead, nostalgia helps us remember
that our lives can have meaning and value,</p>
<p t="227354" d="3280">helping us find the confidence
and motivation</p>
<p t="230634" d="2659">to face the challenges of the future.</p>
